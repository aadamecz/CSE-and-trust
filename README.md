# CSE-and-trust

This folder contains the Online Appendix and a Stata replication package for "Adolescent Core Self-Evaluation and Adult Interpersonal Trust: Evidence from the 1970 British Cohort Study" by Anna Adamecz and Hubert JÃ¡nos Kiss

First working paper: TBA 

Published paper: TBA

After downloading the package, see 1_trust_how_to_run.do for more details. All data are available from the UK Data Service after registration, creating and account, a project, 
and asking for permission at wwww.ukdataservice.ac.uk. If you have any questions, contact me on a.adamecz-volgyi at ucl.ac.uk.

There are five folders in the package: three are empty and should accomodate the raw data ('rawdata'), the data files generated by the do files (once they are run) ('data'), 
and the results ('results'). Two folders have content: 'do' contains the do files and 'logs' contain the logs of our own last running in a subfolder. 

If you use these files please cite our latest publication.
